# **Mpro-25 Lab4_T4 (OPTIONAL)**

## Pre-amble

The two files here are from the Pimoroni examples library - and are the orginal source code you used for the T2 portion of the Lab4 (most of you used the Thermometer.py, its designed to be used with Pimoroni Pico Display that you have in your kit. Some of you tried the Pimoroni Display Pack 2, just a bigger version of the one in the kit.)

For this OPTIONAL lab, make a copy of your T3 code, save it as T4.py and work with that one.

Save your T4 to the Pico (I'm assuming you still have the Pimoroni firmware installed) as main.py so it will run when you power-up the Pico - going forward edit this file (main.py)


# **Lab details (4 new tasks)**

- Task 1, When the button A is pressed - the bargraph is to be switched OFF, and the background colour is set to black (the Bargraph should not come back on again, until the power is cycled (so it's rebooted))
- Task 2, When button B is pressed - the text displaying the current sampled temperature is moved to the center of the screen and stay there, also increase the font size (a property of the display module, specifically .text), until the power is cycled.
- Task 3, change the background color of the displayed text to match the rest of the screen, the text colour should also be changed - both with button X, they should remain like that, until the power is cycled.
- Task 4, change the contents of the displayed text to now show your name (initials), only when button Y is pressed - when released it should return to displaying the temperature, at the same position until the power is cycled.
- Task 5, Add the code to Reset the Pico (a function of the machine module), if both the X & Y buttons are pressed simultaneously.

  *I'm holding down button X.*
