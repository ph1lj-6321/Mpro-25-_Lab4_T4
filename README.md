# **Mpro-25 Lab4_T4 (OPTIONAL)**

Pre-amble

The two files here are from the Pimoroni examples library - and are the orginal source code you used for the T2 portion of the Lab4 (most of you used the Thermometer.py, its designed to be used with Pimoroni Pico Display that you have in your kit. Some of you tried the Pimoroni Display Pack 2, just a bigger version of the one in the kit.)

For this OPTIONAL lab, make a copy of your T3 code, save it as T4.py and work with that one.

Save your T4 to the Pico (I'm assuming you still have the Pimoroni firmware installed) as main.py so it will run when you power-up the Pico - going forward edit this file (main.py)
